Simple Item Management API
This is a basic Node.js HTTP server that implements a RESTful API to manage a list of items. The server can perform the following CRUD operations on a collection of items stored in a data.json file:

GET: Retrieve all items.
POST: Add a new item.
PUT: Update an existing item by its id.
DELETE: Remove an item by its id.
The items are stored in a JSON file (data.json) on the server's filesystem.

üöÄ Features
GET /items: Retrieve all items in the list.
POST /items: Add a new item to the list. The item must have a unique id.
PUT /items: Update an existing item by providing its id.
DELETE /items: Delete an item by its id.
The server validates all input data and ensures proper handling of invalid or missing IDs.

üìÇ Project Structure
server.js: The main file that creates the HTTP server and handles routing logic for CRUD operations.
data.json: The JSON file where the list of items is stored. This file is read and written to when performing CRUD operations.
üíª Getting Started
Requirements
Node.js (preferably the latest LTS version)
Basic knowledge of HTTP requests and JSON data
Installation

Item Not Found: If an item with the specified id cannot be found for PUT or DELETE, the API will return a 404 status code and an error message.
Invalid JSON: If the request body contains invalid JSON, the API will respond with a 400 status code and an error message.
